# SRC Motion Capture System
OptiTrack Documentation: [link](https://docs.optitrack.com/)

Motion Capture Licenses: As of 3/4/2025, we have 2 Unlimited and 4 Tracker licenses (Features for each license: [link](https://optitrack.com/software/motive/pricing.html)). The Unlimited licenses are in the Dance Studio and Field & Construction. Please ask SRC staff about upgrading licenses if needed.

Login/Auth for SRC MoCap Computers: Please ask SRC staff for login / authorization.

Each MoCap Room has a KVM that allows a user to control the MoCap computer remotely via web interface if connected to the local network (Ex: SRC, eduroam, Stanford, Stanford Visitor). To connect, enter the public domain name (i.e. SRC-KVM-Dance.stanford.edu) into a web browser. Accept the security risk by clicking ```Advanced```, and ```Accept the Risk and Continue```.
